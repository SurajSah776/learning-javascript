------------------------ BMI Calculator Challenge ----------------------
***Create a BMI calculator using JavaScript functions. 
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a way of estimating the amount of body fat. It's used in medicine to calculate risk of heart disease.

You can calculate it using the formula below, where 

BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)





Your challenge is to create a function that takes weight and height as inputs and gives the calculated BMI value as an output. The output should be rounded to the nearest whole number.

The first parameter should be the weight and the second should be the height.


*** Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."

BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."

BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."


Code:


function bmiCalculator(weight, height){
    var bmi = (weight/ Math.pow(height,2));
    return bmi;
}

var bmi = bmiCalculator(55, 1.68);
if (bmi > 24.9){
  console.log("Your BMI is "+bmi+", so you are overweight.")
}
else if(bmi >=18.5 && bmi <= 24.9){
    console.log("Your BMI is "+bmi+", so you have a normal weight.")
}
else{
    console.log("Your BMI is "+bmi+", so you are underweight.")
}
